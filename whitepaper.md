DimShade offers a reproducible, transparent, and physically resilient alternative to lattice-based post-quantum cryptography. Its geometric foundation eliminates the need for decoding, key storage, and algebraic structures vulnerable to quantum and physical attacks.

The protocol is simple to implement, easy to audit, and adaptable to both software and hardware environments. Its resistance to Rowhammer, side-channel leakage, fault injection, and hardware trojans makes it a strong candidate for secure deployment in constrained or adversarial settings.

Future work includes formal security proofs, hardware implementations with open verification, integration with existing cryptographic libraries, and publication in peer-reviewed venues. DimShade invites collaboration, critique, and philosophical reflection on the nature of cryptographic trust.
DimShade is implemented in Python using NumPy for matrix operations and random vector generation. The protocol is fully reproducible and can be executed in environments such as Termux, Google Colab, or any standard Python interpreter.

Key generation uses orthogonalization techniques to produce valid SO(n) matrices. The shared secret computation relies on matrix multiplication and scalar projection, which are both efficient and auditable.

The absence of decoding logic and key storage simplifies the implementation and reduces the attack surface. DimShade is suitable for educational use, prototyping, and potential hardware deployment with minimal footprint.

Future versions may include optimized linear algebra backends, hardware acceleration, and formal verification of matrix generation procedures.

DimShade is designed to resist a broad spectrum of attacks, including those that have proven effective against lattice-based schemes like Kyber. The protocol’s geometric nature and lack of decoding or key storage provide inherent resilience.

### Resistance to Quantum Attacks
DimShade does not rely on algebraic structures vulnerable to Shor’s algorithm. The scalar secret is derived from high-dimensional rotations, which are not easily invertible even with quantum resources.

### Resistance to Rowhammer and DRAM-based Attacks
Unlike Kyber, DimShade does not store secret keys in memory. The shared secret is computed dynamically, eliminating the attack surface for memory-flipping techniques.

### Resistance to Side-Channel Leakage
DimShade avoids decoding and uses uniform matrix operations, which can be implemented in constant time. This reduces susceptibility to timing, power, and electromagnetic analysis.

### Resistance to Fault Injection
The protocol does not rely on fragile decoding logic. Faults in matrix operations can be detected through redundant computation or hash verification, and do not compromise the secret.

### Resistance to Hardware Trojans
DimShade’s core logic is compact and modular, allowing for open hardware implementations with formal verification. The absence of decoding and key storage simplifies isolation from I/O and external components.

### Comparison with Kyber and Majorana
Kyber, while standardized, remains vulnerable to physical and implementation-level attacks. Majorana-based systems offer physical quantum security but require exotic infrastructure. DimShade occupies a middle ground: mathematically robust, physically resilient, and practically implementable.

DimShade consists of three main steps:

1. **Key Generation**  
   Each party generates a random matrix A ∈ SO(n) using a reproducible algorithm. These matrices are orthogonal and preserve vector norms.

2. **Public Vector Agreement**  
   A shared public vector v ∈ ℝⁿ is agreed upon. This vector can be generated jointly or transmitted openly.

3. **Secret Computation**  
   Each party computes the scalar secret s = ⟨A · B · v, v⟩, where A and B are the respective orthogonal matrices. Due to the properties of SO(n), both parties arrive at the same scalar value without exchanging private keys.

This protocol avoids key storage, decoding, and algebraic structures vulnerable to quantum or physical attacks. The shared secret is emergent, not stored, and the computation is symmetric and reproducible.

DimShade operates within the special orthogonal group SO(n), the group of n×n real orthogonal matrices with determinant 1. These matrices represent rotations in n-dimensional space and preserve inner products and norms.

Let A and B be randomly generated elements of SO(n), and let v ∈ ℝⁿ be a shared public vector. The shared secret is computed as:

s = ⟨A · B · v, v⟩

This scalar value is symmetric under the exchange of A and B due to the orthogonality of the transformations:

⟨A · B · v, v⟩ = ⟨B · A · v, v⟩

The protocol avoids key storage by generating A and B on demand, and avoids decoding by using scalar projection rather than message recovery. The security of the protocol relies on the difficulty of reconstructing A or B from the scalar s and the public vector v, given the high-dimensional structure and the non-commutative nature of SO(n).

DimShade is built on the principle that cryptographic security should not depend on the secrecy of stored keys, nor on the complexity of algebraic structures vulnerable to quantum or physical attacks. Instead, it embraces a geometric paradigm: secrets emerge from interaction, not from possession.

This approach reflects a shift from static to dynamic cryptography — where the secret is not a thing to be protected, but a process to be enacted. By using orthogonal transformations and scalar projections, DimShade avoids the need for decoding, lattice structures, or key storage, making it inherently resistant to many classes of attacks.

The protocol is designed to be reproducible, auditable, and pedagogically transparent. Every step can be verified, every transformation understood, and every implementation traced. This makes DimShade not only a cryptographic tool, but a philosophical statement about clarity, emergence, and trust.
DimShade is a post-quantum cryptographic protocol based on high-dimensional geometry, specifically transformations in the special orthogonal group SO(n). Unlike lattice-based schemes such as Kyber, DimShade avoids key storage, decoding procedures, and algebraic structures vulnerable to physical and side-channel attacks. The protocol generates a shared scalar secret through joint orthogonal operations and vector projections, offering resistance to quantum algorithms, fault injection, Rowhammer, and hardware trojans. This whitepaper presents the philosophical motivation, mathematical foundations, security analysis, and implementation strategy of DimShade, positioning it as a reproducible and pedagogically transparent alternative to current post-quantum standards.
