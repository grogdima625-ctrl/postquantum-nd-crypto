# Concept: Post-Quantum Cryptography via n-Dimensional Geometric Transformations

## üîê Abstract

This document outlines a cryptographic framework based on transformations in n-dimensional spaces, where dimensionality itself acts as a cryptographic variable. The protocol leverages non-commutative groups such as SO(n), SU(n), and potentially exceptional Lie groups (e.g. G‚ÇÇ, F‚ÇÑ) to construct secure key exchange and encryption mechanisms resistant to quantum attacks.

## üìê Mathematical Foundation

- **Group Structure**: SO(n) and SU(n) are non-abelian Lie groups with rich geometric and algebraic properties.
- **Dimensionality**: The dimension `n` is treated as a cryptographic parameter, influencing the complexity and structure of the key space.
- **Representation**: Group elements are represented via rotation matrices, quaternions (SU(2)), or higher-dimensional analogs.
- **Operation**: Key generation and encryption are performed via group composition and action on fixed vectors or tensors.

## üîÑ Protocol Sketch

1. **Key Generation**:
   - Each party selects a private pair of group elements in SO(n) or SU(n).
   - The public key is derived from their composition or action on a known base vector.

2. **Key Exchange**:
   - Parties exchange public keys and apply their private transformations to derive a shared secret.
   - The dimensionality `n` may be fixed, negotiated, or randomized per session.

3. **Encryption**:
   - Messages are encoded via geometric transformations in the selected nD space.
   - Optional: use topological invariants or tensor embeddings for added obfuscation.

## üß† Security Considerations

- **Quantum Resistance**: Non-commutative structure and high-dimensional complexity hinder quantum algorithms like Shor and Grover.
- **Obfuscation**: Dimensionality and group selection can be hidden or randomized, increasing attack difficulty.
- **Scalability**: Higher dimensions offer increased entropy and adaptability to threat levels.

## üß™ Status

This concept is in early development. Mathematical modeling, simulation, and prototype implementation are ongoing.
