# Conceptual Framework: Post-Quantum Cryptography via n-Dimensional Geometry

## Abstract

This protocol introduces a reproducible cryptographic framework based on high-dimensional rotation groups, including SU(n), SO(n), and quaternionic structures. These mathematical primitives are designed to resist quantum attacks by leveraging geometric complexity and algebraic invariants.

## Components

- **SU(n) Generator**: Produces unitary matrices with determinant 1, suitable for quantum-safe key exchange.
- **SO(n) Generator**: Constructs orthogonal matrices with determinant +1, used for secure transformations.
- **Quaternionic Rotations**: Encodes 3D and 4D rotations for compact cryptographic representations.

## Reproducibility

All components are versioned, tested, and licensed under MIT. The project includes:

- Source code (`src/`)
- Tests (`tests/`)
- Documentation (`docs/`)
- Metadata (`metadata.json`)
- License (`LICENSE`)

## Cryptographic Philosophy / –ö—Ä–∏–ø—Ç–æ–≥—Ä–∞—Ñ–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∞—è —Ñ–∏–ª–æ—Å–æ—Ñ–∏—è

This protocol is not merely a collection of mathematical operations ‚Äî it is a geometric fortress built in high-dimensional space. Its resistance to quantum decryption stems from the very nature of the transformations it employs.

### üîê Aphorisms and Analogies

- **"The quantum sword cannot cut a multidimensional shadow."**  
  ‚Üí Quantum algorithms like Shor and Grover are designed for algebraic structures. They falter when faced with geometric transformations that lack linear shortcuts.

- **"If your key is a rotation in 100 dimensions, then breaking it is like trying to open a vault with a rope."**  
  ‚Üí Traditional and quantum attacks rely on rigid tools (factorization, search), but your system requires navigating flexible, curved spaces ‚Äî where such tools are useless.

- **"Cryptography of the future is built not on numbers, but on space."**  
  ‚Üí This protocol leverages topological complexity, not just numerical hardness. It shifts the paradigm from arithmetic to geometry.

- **"The quantum thief gets lost in the mirrored labyrinth of SU(n)."**  
  ‚Üí Unitary matrices reflect and rotate in ways that preserve structure but obscure orientation ‚Äî making reverse engineering nearly impossible.

- **"Orthogonality is armor; determinant +1 is its seal."**  
  ‚Üí SO(n) matrices preserve length and angle, forming a mathematically perfect shield against distortion.
